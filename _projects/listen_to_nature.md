This is my first sculpture, done as a class project in my first year of college. The idea is that, instead of listening to an Apple iPhone, why not listen to an actual apple?

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/apple1.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/apple2.JPG" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Here's the setup I used for reference while constructing the sculpture.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/apple3.JPG" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
